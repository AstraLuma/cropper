**cropper** does exactly what it says on the tin: it cuts up an image into 
smaller pieces. In particular, it lets you pull as many overlapping sections 
out of an image as you'd like.

Dependencies:
   - Python
   - GTK
   - PyGTK, PyGlib, and PyCairo
   - Python Imaging Library (Recommended)

Under Ubunutu, all of these packages are installed by default.

cropper is known to run on Windows 7, but it is not well tested.
